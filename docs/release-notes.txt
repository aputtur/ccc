Release Notes

Usage of this file:
    * When an application or db developer commits changes to CVS, add notes to
      the "Build <NEXT>" section at the top of this file.  If a "Known Issue"
      was addressed, remove it from that section and note it under "Defects
      Fixed".  With each entry, include the Windows login in square braces to
      indicate who to contact for additional information Concurrent edits to
      this file should be easily resolved through a CVS merge.

    * When a release engineer performs a build, replace the "Build <NEXT>
      (...)" with the actual build info, and create a new "Build <NEXT> (...)"
      section at the top carrying forward the items in the "Known Issues"
      subsection section.

Notes to QA
-----------
#8628 - This is a problem intrinsic to how I display items...  the item is really
        a non-existant permission so there is no rightsholder to get.  Instead I
        am stuffing the publisher in the rightsholder spot.  This should at least
        enable our researchers to track down the rightsholder.

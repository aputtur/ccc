	<p>
		<h2>Terms and Conditions That Apply to All Transactions:</h2>
	</p>
	<p>
		1. This digital licensing and reprint service enables you, the "User", to obtain licenses to make certain uses of the online content of many copyright
		holders (each a "Rightsholder"). Licenses granted through this service are granted by the Rightsholder in the content for which you are seeking a
		license and from whose Website (containing the content) you reached this service. This service is administered by Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.
		("CCC") and your use of the content is governed by these terms and conditions, BUT your use will ALSO be governed by the terms and conditions which are
		set individually by the Rightsholder whose material you seek to use; the Rightsholder's terms and conditions will be made available to you in the
		course of the licensing process for each transaction. You, as User, will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to all of those terms and conditions, as
		well as these terms and conditions, if you use the Rightsholder's copyrighted material in any fashion. CCC reserves the right to send electronic mail
		to you for the purpose of informing you of changes or additions to this service.
	</p>
	<p>
		2. User hereby acknowledges and agrees that User is responsible for any transaction entered into through this digital licensing and reprint service and
		identified with User's user name and password (if on account) or User's credit card information (if by credit card). It is User's responsibility to
		maintain the secrecy of such information, to notify CCC immediately upon learning of any transaction entered into through this service that was done so
		without User's authorization, and to use the appropriate automated services within this digital licensing and reprint service to alter passwords and
		standing payment information whenever necessary to preserve secrecy. User represents and warrants that User is at least 18 years old if User is a
		person (as opposed to a company or other organization); that in any event User is legally capable in User's place of residence or business of entering
		into the agreement created by these terms and conditions and Rightsholder's terms and conditions; and that the individual opening an account or seeking
		transactions under this digital licensing and reprint service on behalf of any User that is a business, corporate entity or other organization is duly
		authorized by User to do so.
	</p>
	<p>
		3. Use of User-related information collected by this licensing service is governed by CCC's privacy policy. CCC's privacy policy is accessible through
		CCC's website <a href="http://www.copyright.com/" target="_newWindow">www.copyright.com</a> and from numerous locations throughout the webpages
		comprising this licensing service.
	</p>
	<p>
		4. As among User, CCC and the Rightsholder, all materials available for licensing, as well as all rights therein, including copyright rights, remain
		the sole and exclusive property of the Rightsholder. All trademarks not belonging to the Rightsholder, as well as all software and other elements that
		you encounter in the course of using this digital licensing and reprint service, as well as all intellectual property rights therein, remain the sole
		and exclusive property of CCC and are not licensed to User in any way. While User may exercise the rights licensed immediately upon issuance of the
		license at the end of the licensing process for the transaction, the license is automatically revoked, and is null and void as if it had never been
		issued, if complete payment for the license is not received on a timely basis either from User directly or through a payment agent, such as a credit
		card company. All rights not expressly granted are reserved; any license granted may be further limited (on a Work-by-Work basis) as set forth in any
		restrictions included in the Rightsholder's terms and conditions applicable to the transaction (which will be provided at the end of the licensing
		process, at User's option, on paper or electronically).
	</p>
	<p>
		5. User hereby indemnifies and agrees to defend CCC and its employees, agents, representatives, officers and directors, against all claims, liability,
		damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, arising out of any use of licensed material beyond the scope of the rights granted, or
		any use of any licensed material which has been altered in any way by User, including claims for defamation or infringement of or damage to rights of
		copyright, publicity, privacy or other tangible or intangible property.
	</p>
	<p>
		6. <strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF CCC</strong>. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CCC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
		DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS OR INFORMATION, OR FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF (i) THE USE OR
		INABILITY TO USE ANY LICENSED MATERIAL OR (ii) THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL RIGHTS TO LICENSED MATERIALS, EVEN IF CCC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
		POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In any event, the total liability of CCC (including its employees, agents, representatives, officers and directors) shall
		not exceed the total amount actually paid by User for the applicable license. User assumes full liability for the actions and omissions of its
		principals, employees, agents, affiliates, successors and assigns.
	</p>
	<p>
		7. <strong>NO WARRANTIES FROM CCC</strong>. CCC DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS OF RIGHTSHOLDER, EITHER EXPRESS OR
		IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN ADDITION, THIS LICENSING SERVICE
		AND ALL SOFTWARE USED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
		WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. USER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT USE
		OF THE SERVICE IS AT USER'S SOLE RISK.
	</p>
	<p>
		8. (a) The term "License Grant" is used in these terms and conditions to describe (i) the entire set of details (including User's name as licensee, the
		nature of the use for which User seeks a license, and the price of the license), as well as (ii) the Rightsholder's terms and conditions applicable to
		that licensing transaction and governing the particular use User may make of that copyrighted material, and (iii) CCC's general terms and conditions
		relating to billing and payment that are applicable to ALL transactions. All elements of the License Grant are printed out or referred to in the
		license document that is delivered to User at the conclusion of each transaction under this digital licensing and reprint service, and are generally
		available within the service's Website at any time.
	</p>
	<p>
		(b) Any failure by User to pay any amount when due, or any use by User of any licensed material beyond the scope of the License Grant, shall be a
		material breach of the License Grant. Any breach not cured within ten (10) days of notice thereof shall result in immediate termination of such license
		without further notice. Invoices are due and payable upon their delivery to User (or upon CCC's notice to User that they are available to User for
		downloading from the Internet); amounts overdue will be subject to a service charge of 1-1/2% per month or, if less, the maximum interest rate allowed
		by applicable law in User's place of business, such service charge to begin running 30 days after delivery of, or notice of availability of, invoice.
	</p>
	<p>
		9. CCC hereby objects to any terms contained in any writing prepared by User or its principals, employees, agents or affiliates and purporting to
		govern or otherwise relate to any licensing transaction, which terms are in any way inconsistent with any of these terms or the Rightsholder's standard
		terms or with any standard operating procedures of Rightsholder or CCC, whether such writing is prepared prior to, simultaneously with or subsequent to
		the License Grant, and whether such writing appears on any paper or electronic version of the License Grant or in a separate paper or electronic
		instrument, unless such writing is countersigned by CCC.
	</p>
	<p>
		10. User may terminate its account at any time by sending e-mail to: customercare@copyright.com. Upon termination, User will receive a confirmation via
		e-mail that the request was received, and access to the licensing service from User's account will be suspended within one business day. User is
		responsible for all charges incurred up to the time the account is deactivated.
	</p>
	<p>
		11. Unless the Rightsholder's own terms and conditions for the License Grant designate different terms for governing law, venue and jurisdiction and
		those terms and conditions are determined by a competent court to apply to a particular dispute, (a) the License Grant shall be governed by and
		construed under the law of the State of New York, USA, without regard to the principles thereof of conflicts of law, (b) any case, controversy, suit,
		action, or proceeding arising out of, in connection with, or related to the License Grant shall be brought, at CCC's sole discretion, in any federal or
		state court located in the County of New York, State of New York, USA, or in any U.S. federal or state court whose geographical jurisdiction covers the
		principal place of business of the Rightsholder, and (c) the parties expressly submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of each such U.S. federal
		or state court.
	</p>
	<p>
		12. User acknowledges and agrees that CCC may alter these terms and conditions in any fashion and at any time, effective immediately, provided that CCC
		posts notice of any material alteration hereof to the location at which User's monthly invoice is made available by CCC on the Internet and any such
		material alteration will be effective on the date set forth in the notice (and which effective date will be at least 30 days following CCC's first
		posting thereof). User also acknowledges and agrees that CCC may, on notice to User at the time of invoicing or at the time of any re-invoicing of a
		past-due amount, assign accounts and/or amounts due either to the applicable Rightsholder or to a financial institution; and that CCC may at any time
		assign all its rights, duties and responsibilities hereunder or under any License Grant to any other person who shall take responsibility for this
		licensing facility. Finally, User acknowledges and agrees that CCC may, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend User's access to all or part of
		the licensing service for any reason, including without limitation breach of this Agreement or persistent failure to pay license fees on a timely
		basis.
